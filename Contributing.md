# Contributing to the Open Research Calendar
 
The point of this guide is to welcome new users and contributors to the **Open Research Calendar**. We welcome all contributions and we hope that these guidelines will make it as easy as possible to get involved.
 
The Open Research Calendar is a community managed tool. We therefore require that all contributors adhere to our **Code of Conduct**
 
The name “Open Research Calendar” rather than “Open Science Calendar” was chosen so that we do not exclude members of the humanities and social sciences from our community. Please ensure that you use this preferred term in your contributions.
