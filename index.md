<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Overview</strong></h1>

The service “Open Research Calendar ([@openresearchcal](https://twitter.com/OpenResearchCal))” was created as a community tool by the attendees of the ‘Advanced Methods in Reproducible Science’ workshop organised by the University of Bristol (also known on Twitter as [#Repro2020](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Repro2020)). The idea was initially generated by attendees of #Repro2019.

The tool was created to serve the open research community in collating worldwide open research events into one database. This translates onto a Google Calendar which can be synced into a person's own personal calendar (updating as new events get added). 

As a community tool, we request that the events added are community policed. In that, if anything is seen to be wrong/duplicated/offensive/inappropriate, we expect the community to report the event (using the [report link](http://tinyurl.com/rcu66l8) in our Twitter bio). A small team of administrators will then review the event details. As the admins volunteer for this, the response time may be long.
