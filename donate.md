The Open Research Calendar (ORC) is a community-powered tool that was created to gather all Open Research events in one place.  You can help support the ORC by making a donation. All donations will be used to support the ORC (including mailing ORC Stickers). There are no fees for donating and 100% of your donation will go to the ORC.

Contributors are listed in the [Donations](#donations) section.

## Open Finances:
We use [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/open-research-calendar) to collect donations and publish a full accounting of how our doantions are spent. Donating via Open Collective adds a couple of extra clicks for you, but it saves us a few sleepless nights 😉. We hope you will support us in working with Open Collective and consider using them for your grassroots projects!

## Instructions:
Click the button below to access our page on Open Collective. From there, scroll down to the "contribute" button to make a donation. You can review our accounting at the bottom of the page.
