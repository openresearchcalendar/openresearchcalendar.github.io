## What are we doing?

This tool was designed to facilitate communication and sharing of global open research events. It was built to help event organisers attract other interested parties to their events, and help individuals find events which they would like to join.

It exists as a community managed tool, where anyone is free to submit an event, and we rely on the community to report suspicious events for removal.

The tool incorporates freely available resources to receive event information, publish it to a Google calendar and post about it on Social Media (LinkedIn, BlueSky and Mastodon).

## Who are we?

We are a small team of researchers who met at [Advanced Methods in Reproducible Science 2020](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/psychology/research/ukrn/ukrnevents/repro2020/) and built on an idea which was submitted for a hackathon at the previous 2019 meeting. We continue to support and develop this community tool alongside our day jobs!

The developers and maintainers of this tool are (alphabetically):
- [Cassandra Gould van Praag](https://ox.ukrn.org/people/#CassandraGouldvanPraag)
- [Bradley Kennedy](https://bradleykennedy.co.uk)
- [Alexandra Lautarescu](https://www.alautarescu.com)
- [Esther Plomp](https://twitter.com/PhDToothFAIRy)

We are supported by the [UK Reproducibility Network (UKRN)](https://www.ukrn.org) so that we can elevate our infrastructure, support development, and raise awareness of this resource within our community.  

## What do we need?

Feedback and contributions!

The tool was designed, developed and launched in under 5 days in January 2020. Since then we have been making tweaks to the workflows and adding features as and when we have the time available!

We welcome feedback on any aspect of the tool via our [Github Issues](https://github.com/openresearchcalendar/Open-Research-Calendar/issues).
